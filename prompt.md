I want to build a stellar website for my elite software consulting company Tentacle Software. 

I want sitemaps and search engine integration to surface on all search results for building custom software.

I also want a calendar link to book in time with me.

I do:

* Building large-scale, high-performance web platforms
* Designing and optimising cloud-native API backends
* Coaching and scaling high-performing engineering teams
* Streamlining developer workflows for maximum productivity
* Crafting agentic and AI-driven automation systems
* Mentoring business on the benefits of AI tools and how to use them for developers.

Create a team of expert agents to get this done.

This website has no backend. It's front end only.

Give me recommendations for hosting this cheaply.
